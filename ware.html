    <h1>Warehouse Robot</h1>
    <p>I worked with a team to build a warehouse robot, serving as the team leader throughout the project. Its purpose was to transfer boxes and release them at designated locations.We researched and selected the necessary materials, purchased the components, assembled the entire system, and programmed the robot car ourselves.The project took twelve weeks to complete, and we presented our final work.</p>
